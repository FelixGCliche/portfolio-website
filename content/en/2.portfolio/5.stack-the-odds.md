Stack the Odds is a dice tower building game, where your goal is to try to stack a variety of randomly generated dices as high as possible.  
This game was created in 48h during GMTK 2022, the biggest gamejam on itch.io with more than 6000 games submitted.  
I worked in a team of 3 and I was in charge of the UI along with the input system.
