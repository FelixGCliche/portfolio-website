Aloha is a 2D platformer where you command the temperature around you to venture into 5 dungeons and gather the abilities necessary to escape.  
This is my final project for my software development degree at the Cégep de Sainte-Foy. It was developed full-time during a whole semester with a team of 3 other classmates.  
I did the player movement, entity collision system as well as designed the third level and the grappling ability in it. I also made some art for the game, mainly the sprites for two types of enemies.
