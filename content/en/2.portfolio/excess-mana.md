Excess Mana is a tower defense game where you play a wizard who must defend his temple from waves of elemental slimes attracted by it's mana influx.  
During the day, you need to to gather resources and upgrade your temple's defense while at night you must defend against the waves of slimes.  
This game was created during a 48h gamejam organized by the University of Quebec at Chicoutimi (UQAC). I was invited by 3 of my friends who where students there at the time.  
I worked on the resource gathering and the player inventory in addition to the main character's art.
