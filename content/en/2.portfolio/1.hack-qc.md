La pause électrique is an android application that lets you find nearby charging stations for your car along with activities and places to visit while your car charges up.  
I made this application for the Hack QC hackathon, where my 3 friends and I proceeded to win 3rd place even though it was our first coding event experience.  
This app was made with Java and I was in charge of the UI and assets.
