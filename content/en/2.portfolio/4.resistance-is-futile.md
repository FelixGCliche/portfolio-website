Resistance is Futile is a turn-based rogue-like where you control a group of 3 characters fighting endless waves of enemies.  
This game was created during a 48h gamejam organized by the University of Quebec at Chicoutimi (UQAC). I was invited by 3 of my friends who where students there at the time.  
I worked on the progression system as well as the player inventory.
